# todo-with-grpc

I implemented [gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/) in this project. 

To run the server open terminal and run the below:
> go run server/main.go

To run the client open another teminal window and run the below:
> go run client/main.go

The requests and responses are printed in the terminal.
